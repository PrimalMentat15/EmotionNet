# EmotionNet 🎭  
A Facial Expression Recognition System using CNN and FER2013 Dataset  
> A Deep Learning model trained to classify human emotions from grayscale facial images.

---

## 🧠 Overview

**EmotionNet** is a facial expression recognition project that classifies facial emotions using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained on the **FER2013 dataset**. The model distinguishes between seven emotional categories: **Angry, Disgust, Fear, Happy, Sad, Surprise,** and **Neutral**.

This notebook-based project explores data preprocessing, model building using Keras and TensorFlow, training, evaluation, and result visualization. It is aimed at applications in emotion-aware AI systems and human-computer interaction.

## 🎯 Objective

To develop a deep learning pipeline that:
- Loads and preprocesses the FER2013 dataset.
- Trains a custom CNN to classify facial expressions.
- Evaluates the model using metrics and visualizations.
- Plots training performance (accuracy and loss).
- Demonstrates emotion prediction on test samples.

## 📦 How to Run (via Google Colab)

1. Open the notebook: [EmotionNet.ipynb](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/11x7maRXKX2v2SU85y_MPlM0d8bnIN0tO?usp=sharing)
2. Upload the **FER2013 CSV file** from Kaggle to your Colab environment.
3. Run each cell sequentially:
 - Data loading and preprocessing
 - Model architecture definition
 - Model training
 - Evaluation
 - Predictions on test samples
